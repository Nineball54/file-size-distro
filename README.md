# file-size-distro
Another Rosetta Code Program in Rust

My attempt for an entry on Rosetta Code's https://rosettacode.org/wiki/File_size_distribution (as of this writing, draft) task.

Should be run in terminal, will search and report on the directory the .exe is in if target is otherwise unspecified.

Currently only guaranteed to work on Win10! Will test and adapt for other platforms for fun later.
